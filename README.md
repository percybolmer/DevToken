# Decentralized Application
This is a repository built while writing an article on my blog on Medium.  

The repository consists of four articles.

## [Building a decentralized application with BEP-20 Contract in Solidity](https://itnext.io/building-a-decentralized-application-with-bep-20-contract-in-solidity-d2c066447aa6)
In this article we start to learn the basics of Solidity and start implementing the BEP-20 interfaces.  
The code is found in the BEP20 branch of this repository.
## [Creating a Inheritable Staking Contract In Solidity](https://itnext.io/creating-a-inheritable-staking-contract-in-solidity-7804ae2d7a32)
In this article we start implementing Staking and Rewards for staking.  
The code for this is found in the Stakable branch of this repository.

## [Using a Smart Contract In An Web Application](https://itnext.io/using-a-smart-contract-in-an-web-application-78432ed68527)
We start investigating how to connect to the Blockchain in a Web application. 
The code can be found in the DApp branch of this repository. 

## [Deploying Smart Contracts to Binance Smart chain withÂ Truffle](https://itnext.io/deploying-smart-contracts-to-binance-smart-chain-with-truffle-c57a7d1eb6ed)
We deploy the smart contract to the Testnet and also learn how to connect everything together.
